## Beginner tutorials for Python

Hi Velocity Wizards, as you may know Python is the currently the lingua franca for any person workign in data or A.I. related fields. 
Here is where you can learn basics of Python for Data Science.  

Here are some reasons why Python is very versatile.

1. Scalability
Python is a programming language that scales very fast. Among all available languages, Python is a leader in scaling. That means that Python has more and more 
possibilities. Python flexibility is super useful for any problem in-app development

Any problem can be decided easily with new updates that are coming. Saying that Python provides the best options for newbies because there are many ways to 
decide the same issue. Even if you have a team of non-Python programmers, who knows C+ +design patterns, Python will be better for them in terms of time needed 
to develop and verify code correctness.

It happens fast because you don`t spend your time to find memory leaks, work for compilation or segmentation faults.

2. Libraries and Frameworks
Due to its popularity, Python has hundreds of different libraries and frameworks which is a great addition to your development process. 
They save a lot of manual time and can easily replace the whole solution. As a Data Scientist, you will find that many of these libraries will be focused on 
Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Also, there is a huge support for Big Data. I suppose there should be a strong pro why you need to learn Python as your 
first language.

Some of these libraries are given below:

Pandas
It is great for data analysis and data handling. Pandas provides data manipulation control.

NumPy
NumPy is a free library for numerical computing. It provides high-level math functions along with data manipulations.

SciPy
This library is related to scientific and technical computing. SciPy can be used for data optimization and modification, algebra, special functions, etc.

3. Web Development
To make your development process as easy as it is possible only, learn Python. There are a lot of Django and Flask libraries and frameworks that make your 
coding productive and speed up your work.

If you compare PHP and Python, you can find that the same task can be created within a few hours of code via PHP. But with Python, it will take only a few minutes. 
Just take a look at Reddit website — it was created with Python.

Here are Pythons Full Stack frameworks for web development:

Django
Pyramid
Web2py
TurboGears
And here are Pythons micro-frameworks for web development:

Flask
Bottle
CherryPy
Hug
Also, there is an alternative framework you might want to consider:

Tornado
4. Huge Community
As I have mentioned before, Python has a powerful community. You might think that it shouldn`t be one of the main reasons why you need to select Python. 
But the truth is vice versa.

If you don`t get support from other specialists, your learning path can be difficult. That`s why you should know that this won`t happen with your 
Python learning journey.

Here is a list of some Python communities:

5. Automation
Using Python automation frameworks like PYunit gives you a lot of advantages:

No additional modules are required to install. They come with the box
Even if you don`t have Python background you will find work with Unittest very comfortable. It is derivative and its working principle is similar to other 
xUnit frameworks. You can run singular experiments in a more straightforward way. You should simply indicate the names on the terminal. The output is compact 
too, making the structure adaptable with regards to executing test cases. The test reports are generated within milliseconds.

3. Pytest

4. Behave

5. Lettuce

6. Jobs and Growth
Python is a unique language that has powerful growth and opens multiple career opportunities for Data Scientists. If you learn Python you can consider multiple 
additional jobs you might want to make the switch to in the future:

Python Developer
Product Manager
Educator
Financial Advisors
Data Journalist

7. Salary
If you are looking for high paying opportunities, Python has massive options for you. Just check these stats:

Conclusion
Python is a base for any Data Scientist. There are many reasons to select this powerful programming language, so it’s up to you which reason will be main. 
You should definitely consider Python due to its possibilities and ongoing improvement, which will help you to build amazing products and help businesses.
